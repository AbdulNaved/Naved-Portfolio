            Hey, I&apos;m Naved! I hail from India, where the vibrant culture
            and rich diversity have always inspired my creativity. Growing up,
            I&apos;ve been captivated by the fusion of art and technology, and
            it&apos;s what led me into the world of development.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a self-taught developer, I&apos;ve embarked on a journey to blend
            my passion for design with technical expertise. Specializing in
            front-end development, I craft immersive digital experiences that
            seamlessly merge functionality with aesthetics. I am a full-stack
            developer, constantly pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible in
            the digital realm.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond coding, I immerse myself in the realm of digital art,
            constantly exploring new techniques and styles. You&apos;ll often
            find me delving into the latest trends in web animation, pushing the
            boundaries of what&apos;s achievable in the digital realm.
            <br />
            <br />
            Join me as I continue to push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible
            in the digital world!
